Project Idea Outline
We will look at states' yearly spending on parks and recreation compared to their spending on infrastructure. We will do this by first combining our found data sets in order for there to be a single table with all the necessary features (% of state spending on parks, % of state spending on highways, voting history, etc). Before we begin our statistical analysis, we will conduct exploratory data analysis, creating graphs to investigate relationships between different variables. We will then conduct statistical analysis, relying mostly on ANOVA tests to analyze a possible connection between the budget allocation ratio (parks & recreation : transportation infrastructure) and presidential voting history. From there we can work on generating effective visualizations for the written report, using R. This will give us the necessary components to start writing our final report and accompanying final presentation. 
There are many animals that only live in state parks, and the funding those parks receive is necessary for both their survival and studying them. Humanity has learned so many things from studying animals in their natural habitats, and having protected spaces for those animals to live is necessary in increasing our understanding of our planet as a whole. In addition to benefitting nature, parks & recreation benefit their communities. In other parts of the world, there is much a larger fiscal emphasis on creating green spaces. We are interested in exploring if states whose spending patterns are more reminiscent of these other countries are typically more blue states or red states. While a minimum amount of transport infrastructure is necessary for life, investing more in parks for the benefit of the citizens should be a bipartisan focus.
